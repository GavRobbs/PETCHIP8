# PETCHIP8
A Chip-8 emulator written entirely in python, using pygame. My pet project. Please check out my blog if you're here at www.gavinrobinson.net!

It's fairly straightforward. I decided to implement it as an interface rather than just a runnable class so that you could implement your own graphics library, and not necessarily be stuck using pygame.
